      "description": "For three days, in collaboration with Saatchi & Saatchi, Wildlife had a booth in Herald Square, New York, and Hollywood and Highland, Los Angeles, for an interactive experience for Toyota's campaign. The experience connected two people across the country with webcams and a touchscreen they could draw on. The drawings were displayed on both screens along with prompts like \"Draw yourselves under the ocean.\" It was challenging to get everything working in a month, but worth it when seeing people engage in a truly meaningful experience! \n\n My favorite part was when a man with no arms came in and drew on the screen with his feet -- he was quite an impressive artist! The other highlights included little kids who were eager to draw on such a big screen, a man in a batman costume, and a Johnny Depp impersonator.",

It's like the backend ([oschader-cinder](https://github.com/ulyssesp/oschader-cinder)) is the strings of a piano, and code snippets are the keys. By generalizing possible operations into two groups, outputs and inputs, and allowing almost any combination between the two types, an infinite number of unique visuals can be achieved. \n\n The system is built in an abstract way so that adding new visuals is easy. Because of this, Oschader-Cinder is my experimental ground for visual algorithms like flocking, smoke simulation, and math-based glsl shaders.",

To do this we created an interactive experience where the user was presented footage of a play followed by three options of which call to make next. They used the stats to decide on a play and then pointed to the screen to select it and play it. The interaction was powered by Touchdesigner and Kinect. The NBA also requested a tablet experience to be playable while executives waiting for meetings. We adapted the interactive experience to use multitouch and installed it on Surface Pro tablets.",
