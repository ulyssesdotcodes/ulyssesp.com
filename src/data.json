      "description": "For three days, in collaboration with Saatchi & Saatchi, Wildlife had a booth in Herald Square, New York, and XYZ, Los Angeles, an interactive experience for Toyota's campaign. Along with one other developer, I developed an application which connected two users across the country in real time. The application let users draw on the screen with their fingers while watching a live webcam feed of the other person. By combining the drawings on screen, it allowed them to draw together and encouraged them with prompts like \"Draw yourselves under the sea.\" and \"Draw yourselves on a perfect sunny day.\" The videos of drawing and webcam were combined together into a short clip which was posted on the @Toyota twitter feed. My favorite part was when a man with no arms came in and drew on the screen with his feet -- he was quite an impressive artist! \n\n Satchi & Satchi were so impressed with this project that they considered putting it up permanently in their offices.",
